## _User Personas_
_**Ben - Guy who needs a site:**_
_**Needs:**_

_**How can we serve? :**_








## _User Stories_
_**Mary - Digital Artist:**_











## _**Creative Planning**_
_**What do we want to convey:**_
_Professional AND creative/artsy feel_
_More on the "luxurious" and "cool" side_
_Well catered for professionals of varying types_
_Diverse workspaces! Accommodating to all kinds of business!_
_Consistent, high speed internet and needed hardware!_
_Quality amenities to facilitate focus and comfort._
_WE MAKE WORK EASIER FOR EVERYONE!!!_

_**How shall we convey this:**_
_Critical information will be communicated immediately, utilizing icons and brief, succinct, well placed descriptions._
_Strategically placed images and more laid back, unobtrusive fonts on the landing page._
_"Low key" color scheme that simultaneously conveys professionalism and creativity, Likely based around Orange or Yellow._
_KEEP CONTENT NEAR MIDDLE OF SCREEN._
_Display User feedback in the form of quotes or recommendations._

_**User story insights:**_
_Most critical information thoroughly communicated immediately._
_Site should be easy to navigate for those who are less "technologically" oriented._
_Look and feel should be immediately understood by user, without reading any "fine details"_
